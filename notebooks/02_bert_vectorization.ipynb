    "# 02. BERT vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "[BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) is an NLP language representation method introduced by Google. It is a model which creates a contextual vector representation for given text. As a result, unilike word2vec or GloVe, it doesn't have a single word vector, but different ones, depending on its neighbouring words (context). By these means, the algorithm is able to encode some more complex concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is tested in an unsupervised manner, using publicly available texts and it's deeply bidirectional. Currently, BERT is state-of-the-art algorithm for many different NLP tasks. A great explanation of the internals, may be found here: http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/."

    "Creating an embedding vector for a given text with BERT is extremely easy. We take a text, tokenize it and put as an input to the network and then take a value of one of the hidden layers. To make things even simpler, there is a [bert-as-service](https://github.com/hanxiao/bert-as-service) project that exposes the BERT functionality over TCP (internally ZeroMQ is being used). Now, the vectorization is possible within just 2 lines of code."
